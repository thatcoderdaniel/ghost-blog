# About

Hey there! I'm Robert Daniel Manole, and I'm on the front lines of cloud infrastructure at TELUS, where I work as a Cloud Infrastructure Analyst for Google Cloud Platform. Based in Montreal, I've been fortunate to spend over 5 years at TELUS, evolving from Google Workspace support to managing critical infrastructure challenges for enterprise customers.

My journey started with Google Workspace administration, but I quickly found my calling in the deeper technical challenges of cloud infrastructure. Today, I diagnose and solve complex technical problems for Compute Engine across Linux, Windows, and Kubernetes environments. I collaborate with engineers and subject matter experts to architect optimal solutions for VPC networking, containerization with Terraform, and secure backup strategies.

What drives me? Transforming critical technical issues into clear, actionable roadmaps that empower clients to operate with confidence in the cloud. I handle 15+ critical escalations weekly, and there's something incredibly satisfying about turning a client's worst day into a success story.

I'm a continuous learner at heart. At 30, I dove back into algebra because I finally understood its importance - better late than never, right? I regularly read technical papers (currently working through Google's F1 paper - fascinating stuff about distributed SQL databases), and I'm constantly exploring new AWS projects to put theory into practice.

When I'm not deep in cloud architecture, you'll find me writing daily insights, practicing hot yoga (a discovery that truly transformed me), or diving into books that challenge how I think - from Curtis Jackson's "Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter" to communication strategies that help me better connect with the brilliant people I work with.

This blog is where I share what I'm learning, both technically and personally. Whether it's a deep dive into distributed systems, lessons from enterprise deployments, or reflections on growth and mindset, I write to spark that same fire of continuous improvement in others.

My philosophy is simple: busy doesn't equal productive, and there's always room to grow. The key is to start, stay curious, and remember that your potential is just getting started.

**What I work with daily:**
- Google Cloud Platform (Compute Engine, VPC, Kubernetes)
- Infrastructure automation with Terraform
- Enterprise-scale troubleshooting and incident management
- Cross-functional collaboration with engineering teams
- Security and backup strategy implementation
