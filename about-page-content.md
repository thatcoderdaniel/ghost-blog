# About

I'm Robert Daniel Manole, a cloud infrastructure specialist based in Montreal with a passion for building scalable, enterprise-grade solutions on modern cloud platforms.

My expertise spans across Google Cloud Platform and AWS, where I design and implement production-ready architectures that balance performance, security, and cost efficiency. I have extensive experience with containerization, microservices, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure automation.

Currently, I focus on helping organizations migrate to cloud-native architectures while maintaining operational excellence. My approach combines deep technical knowledge with practical business considerations, ensuring that infrastructure decisions support both immediate needs and long-term growth.

When I'm not architecting cloud solutions, I enjoy documenting my technical discoveries and sharing insights from real-world implementations. This blog serves as a platform where I explore complex infrastructure challenges, document best practices, and share lessons learned from production deployments.

**Technical Specialties:**
